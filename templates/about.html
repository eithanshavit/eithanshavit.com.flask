<p>Hi, my name is Eithan Shavit. I am a Software Engineer at Arista Networks.</p>
<p>To pass the time I don't have between work and married life, I create tiny
projects. The purpose of these projects is mainly to learn and gain experience new
technologies. This website for instance, is built using Python Flask and Jinja2.
Not that it's really needed for such a simple website.</p>
