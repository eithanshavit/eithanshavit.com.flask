 <p>This is a heavily customized WordPress PHP website.</p>
<p>It is a recipe blog, combined with creative short stories. My good friend is
the writer, cook and photographer. While I build and maintain the website, and
photoshops the photos.</p>
<p>To develop and launch the website, I used an Amazon Web Services VPS (the one
we're on now). Since this is a non-profit website, the virtual server we used had very limited
resources. This brought up some scalability challenges, as more and more people
started using it. To run a real website on a VM with <5% CPU time and 600Mb RAM,
some MySql, Apache and virtual memory tricks were used. When development was
done, we moved to a shared hosting solution, to save some money.</p>
<p>It's great fun working on such a website, that combines art, food and web
development.</p>
