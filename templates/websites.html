<p>This is a customized WordPress PHP website.</p>
<p>It is a recipe blog, combined with creative short stories. My good friend is
the writer, cook, and photographer, while I build and maintain the website, and
edit the photos.</p>
<p>To develop and launch the website, I used an Amazon Web Services VPS (the one
we're on right now). Since this is a non-profit website, the virtual server we used had very limited
resources. This brought up some scalability challenges, as more and more people
started using our website. To run a real website on a VM with less than 5% CPU time and 600Mb RAM,
some MySql, Apache and virtual memory tricks were used. When development was
done, we moved to a shared hosting solution, in order to save some money.</p>
<p>It's great fun working on such a website that combines art, food, and web
development.</p>

<p>This site!</p>
<p>Created using Python Flask and Jinja2. It is running on an Amazon Web Services
EC2 micro instance, and it is very low on resources (is it slow?). But hey, it's free for the
first year.</p>
